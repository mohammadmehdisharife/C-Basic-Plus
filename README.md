  <h3>C-Basic+ is a programming language developed by <strong>FuSoft</strong>.</h3>
</div>

C-Basic+ is written in **C++ using an older standard** to ensure cross-platform compatibility. It is highly optimized for speed and can even run on **Windows 98**.

The main goal of C-Basic+ is **software development**. It is actively maintained and will continue to receive updates, including new syntax and libraries. Currently, it provides a set of simple syntax elements sufficient for writing programs.

**In the future, with its libraries, C-Basic+ aims to enable developers to create an entire operating system.**

The language is currently at **version 1.0.0** and is licensed under the **GNU License**.

## Features
- 💻 **Cross-platform:** Runs on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and even Windows 98.
- 🛠️ **High performance:** Optimized for older systems with weak CPUs and 32-bit architecture.
- 📃 **Old standard C++:** Compiled using *GCC version 4.6.1 (TDM-1)*.
- ⌨️ **Interpreted language:** Whitespace is not strictly enforced, and error messages are clear and informative (future versions will improve this further).
- 🚀 **Expandable:** More features and libraries will be added in future releases.

⚠️ **Currently, there is no officially defined standard file format for C-Basic+.**
