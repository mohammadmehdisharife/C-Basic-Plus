  <h3>C-Basic+ is a programming language developed by <strong>FuSoft</strong>.</h3>
</div>

<p>
C-Basic+ is written in <strong>C++ using an older standard</strong> to ensure cross-platform compatibility. It is highly optimized for speed and can even run on <strong>Windows 98</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The main goal of C-Basic+ is <strong>software development</strong>. It is actively maintained and will continue to receive updates, including new syntax and libraries. Currently, it provides a set of simple syntax elements sufficient for writing programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the future, with its libraries, C-Basic+ aims to enable developers to create an entire operating system.</b>
</p>

<p>
The language is currently at <strong>version 1.0.0</strong> and is licensed under the <u>GNU License</u>.
</p>

<h4>Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>💻 <strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Runs on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and even Windows 98.</li>
  <li>🛠️ <strong>High performance:</strong> Optimized for older systems with weak CPUs and 32-bit architecture.</li>
  <li>📃 <strong>Old standard C++:</strong> Compiled using <em>GCC version 4.6.1 (TDM-1)</em>.</li>
  <li>⌨️ <strong>Interpreted language:</strong> Whitespace is not strictly enforced, and error messages are clear and informative (future versions will improve this further).</li>
  <li>🚀 <strong>Expandable:</strong> More features and libraries will be added in future releases.</li>
